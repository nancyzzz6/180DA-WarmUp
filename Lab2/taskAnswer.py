# 1. MQTT can be used for multiple players' connections in the prjoject.

#2 - When I tried more similar sounding words, the results didn't show 
# well as before. In noisy situation, the performance was even worse

# (a)what can you with your given speech program in the project?
# The speech program can be a way the player use to intereact with the system

# (b) How complex do you want your speech recognition to be? How complex can you reasonably expect your speech recognition to be?
# I don't think the speech recognition will be too complex for our project because it's not mainly a word game

# (c) What level of speech accuracy do you need? In other words, how quickly do you need an accurate recognition? Does a missed recognition hurt the progress of the game?
# I think the accuracy should be above 90%, and I hope the recognition within 5 sec. A missed recognition should not hurt the progress of the game

# (d) Do you need specific hardware, specific conditions, etc. to have a reasonable confidence that it works well enough?
# I think we will need a relative quiet room and maybe a usb microphone.
